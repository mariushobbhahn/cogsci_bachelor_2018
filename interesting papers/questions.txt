#paper on vae:
1. what is the lower bound conceptually
2. how does the latent space look like? Is it one distribution or a vector of distributions

#what datasets can I use?
1. mnist is a good trial example but seems to be too easy
2. can I use random noise to destroy the picture or more fancy stuff such as one pixel attackes? 
(this becomes more complicated very quickly)

#inverse classification:
1. give broken image without label. get label by recognition and new image. feed new image and label into what?
2. training process is essentially: x-fold iteration of the autoencoder -> classification etc.

#titel:
1. making recognition of noisy images more robust with variational autoencoders and iterative/inverse classification
2.
