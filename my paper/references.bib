abstract="This paper shows that active-inference-based, flexible, adaptive goal-directed behavior can be generated by utilizing temporal gradients in a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN learns a dynamical sensorimotor forward model of a partially observable environment. It then uses this model to execute goal-directed policy inference online. The internal neural activities encode the predictive state of the controlled entity. The active inference process projects these activities into the future via the RNN's recurrences, following a tentative sequence of motor commands. This sequence is adapted by back-projecting error between the forward-projected hypothetical states and the desired goal states onto the motor commands. As an example, we show that a trained RNN model can be used to precisely control a multi-copter-like system. Moreover, we show that the RNN can plan hundreds of time steps ahead, unfolding non-linear imaginary paths around obstacles.",
