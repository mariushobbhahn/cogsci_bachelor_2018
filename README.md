This is the bachelor thesis of Marius Hobbhahn. (Matr.: 4003731)
Adviser is Sebastian Otte.

The thesis tries to implement a inverse classification algorithm on a recurrent neural network (RNN)

Weights and many other forms of data storage are not pushed due to size issues. 

The results itself can be found in my thesis in the section: my paper.
